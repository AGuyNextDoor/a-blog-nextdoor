# AI list of models

## Deegres of learning

**Global Hypothesis**: Increasing the number of degrees of learning of a model, increases the variance and the generalibility of a model, leading to more robust AIs.

### Deegre One : Google Search - IGWAA (If Google Was An Ability)

**Summary**: Learning to make search on google and make "relevant" researches/summary/answers.
**Idea**: The global concept is to make search and answer tool kit that would be "pluggable" to other models as part of a new learning input medium.

## Random Ideas

### Sprouting NN

Building NN that learns "rules" of a system. Trying to heuristicly search for the smallest network that can answer equation rules.

- This is to fight the curse of intelligence with over deep networks that fails to find simple relationships in models
  
Ideas: 
- Should the algorithm grow nodes and test rapidly if with k he is able to answer the problem? if he fails, he grows k+1 layers of nodes. And so on.
- Should their be priority path in a NN path? The most "important nodes" are taken in priority when solving a problem and if it fails it adds the second rank neurons and so on.
- Should NN be allowed to have a "thinking" time before solving a problem? Putting an emphasizes on understading the goal of a problem, prioritizing certain paths
