Create a server on a computer that records the twitch chat commands and makes them play on a launched game. The tchat commands are similar to the famous series "**Twitch Plays**". 

The idea is that when a player enters, a profile is created for him, and a player actually appears on the screen with his name !

The tchat has to create synergies to achieve certain quests together and defeat bosses.

Different twitch channel could be created like a 3 faction, and each channel is a faction and they fight each other off.

Twitch has a whole Auth authentification to do cool stuff with it.

Twitch has reward points that can go with it and work. 
- E.g The more a player plays, the more his actions are rewarded.

A mirror website could be made where you would follow your character, factions and maybe modify your character.

An AI could be made that learns how the tchat behaves and adapts to it. 

E.g : Create a "Twitch plays tamagochi" and they have to make him live as long as possible.
