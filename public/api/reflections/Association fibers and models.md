What is the equivalent of [[Association Fibers]] in the [[Cerebral Cortex]] and connexion between different [[Model]]s in [[Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)]]?

It's like we could have different [[Model]]s (one reponsible for a 'function') just like regions in [[Brodmann's map]] and all connect them via an [[Association Fibers]].
