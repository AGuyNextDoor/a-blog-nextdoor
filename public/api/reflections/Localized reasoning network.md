Linked to the research of this idea [[Self generating Neuron Model]]. It's a first simpler version focused on finding the architecture behind it.

Divide problem solving in different categories? 
Like : 
- Reasoning
- Association
- Math
- Logic 
- etc 

For each type of reasoning, train a neural network that overfits on the concept.
Then train another neural network that trains from the results of those $x$ neural network.
