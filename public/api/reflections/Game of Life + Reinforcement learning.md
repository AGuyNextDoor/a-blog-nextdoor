In the [[Game of Life]] game, use the original game but where the rules may vary during the playthrough.

Discrete rule AI : 
- The controls of the AI is the ability to change the different rules of the game when he wants.
- For each amount of neighbors, choosing if alive of dead, and if birth or ignore.
	- The goal is still to not be in a balanced state, to have creation and structure
	- *still need to be properly defined*


Continuous rule AI : 
- Same as the previous AI except instead of having **binary** decision, a gradient between 0 and 1 which would be converted to probabilities of *alive/dead* or *birth/ignore* for a more precise control.
