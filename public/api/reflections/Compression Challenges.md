COMPRESSION === Intelligence

## Task
Compress 1GB of Wikipedia

current best: 8.58 compression factor (down to 117MB)


## Motivation 

"Being able to compress well is closely related to acting intelligently, thus reducing the slippery concept of intelligence to hard file size numbers"


# IDEA

Use ML techniques to reduce the volume of the initial file
How much random percentage of random characters can we delete in a file and still use an AI to reconstruct? 
Can we use word compression (e.g. replace "**theorem** by **th**") as well?
