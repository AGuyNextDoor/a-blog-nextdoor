# Melinda and Sena      

## Notes 

Work on the self

Do a modern version of the **_Questions of King Milinda_** ?

Might be too deep in the question of identity.. 

A mix of sanity, identity, and the questions of king Milinda? 

**What do I want people to come out with this book?**  
Like you’ve finished reading it I want to see: 

- WTF?

- 

  

**The questions of King Milinda**

-   Characters: 

-   King Milinda => **Melinda**, Milinda
-   Nagasena => Nagasena, Nagasenna, Naga, **Sena**, Senna, TO DO

1.  Do a short story of the concept behind this. 

1.  Don’t bother too much about the philosophy behind this and focus on the technicalities behind the concept

## **Role play**
  

The idea is based on two persons engaged, person A and person B, in a relationship that have a game where they play roles in their daily lives. (Just like in [**this**](https://www.webtoons.com/en/slice-of-life/yumi-cell/ep-489-muse-my-love/viewer?title_no=478&episode_no=490) webtoon at the middle where Soonrok transforms in a delivery man)

The trick is that the lector is limited by the degrees of freedom given by words in a book.  
The role play goes to a second depth, where the names are changed, and the characters know they are playing a game but not the readers. After a time, person A says to stop the game and the reader realises that it was person B all along. (The two characters saw each other’s face and so they knew all along it was a game). 

It goes a step further, as at one point, they go again in this role play but person A then asks for the role play to stop but the character that she talks to is just troubled and responds « who is person B ? ». There goes the whole stressed situation where she doesn’t understand asks to really stop and that its not funny but the persons continues to deny.

  

## **Self and Identity**

  

If the concept really wants to be pushed, at one point we can go on about the 4th wall where the main characters learns about that she is a fictional characters and that she is limited in her self and identity. 

This would come in direct contrast with a lot of their discussion about who they are and what it is to be, the identity etc etc

There is a strong discussion here to have where they talk about “book characters” and how that limits or expands the identity of the characters.

  

## Perception’s Scope

  

The scope of perception is : The groups of persons and topics that are perceptible at a given time in the book.

The idea here is that the book should follow a **cone** in term of perception’s scope. 

The beginning of the book should give character A a discussion about life, her work and everything around her (The scope is large, close to maximal). As the book goes on and goes a bit berserk, the scope gets smaller and smaller. She focuses on her relationship in general with other people, then her relationship with person B, then herself 

1.  The world’s state
2.  The country

1.  Her family
2.  Her relationships (seduction in general) and friends
3.  Her only relationship
4.  The fantasy and the role play
5.  Her Vs the role play
6.  Her

  

## Order

1.  Introducing narrator rapidly, her personality and her life.

	-   Some key insights should be given her about her later dementia or futur wtf moments

1.  She meets character B and they seduce each other.

	-   Directly talking about the role play situation
	-   This should introduce the seduction both characters strongly enjoy
	-   This should introduce character B

3.  Introducing their relationship

	-   This should give in enough liberty for the main plot to happen

4.  Goes directly into this game where she is in a restaurant and she is engaged by a stranger, and we are dived into this seduction game before understanding way later that it was a game and that they are laughing about it.
5.  A break 
6.  Going back into a game, the reader still unaware, quickly the narrator asks to stop (_need to find why_) but the person in front of the narrator seems to be unaware of the situation the narrator is referring to. 
7.  A short conclusion to the short story? Or it could be left on this note if the goal is to try only the concept. 

	-   Should still show a bit about the sanity and identity theme.
