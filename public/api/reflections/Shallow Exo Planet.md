[[AstroPhysics]] #Space #Physics [[Exoplanet]]

The idea is that find if a shallow planet could host a sustainable form of life. 

- The idea has an external crust protecting it from the outside. 
- The planet is rotating fast enough to alllow life to live on the inside of the crust.
	- People are the most centripital force on the equator of the planet, and the more they go up to the poles, the lighter they are.
- The core of the planet is dense enough to be in fusion/magma and brings light and heat to the inside of the planet. 

Open questions : 
- Why is there no one digging? 
- Water cycle?
- No UV light? 

a #Book could be written on this.!
