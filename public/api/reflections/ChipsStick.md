# ChipStick

You like chips? Don't like greasy fingers? You eat those delicious potatoes big chunks?

Eat them with chopsticks!

## Arguments

The year is 2020. We often are exposed to tactile surfaces (*aren't all surfaces tactile?*) and devices requiring the touch of our fingers.

But we know that dirty and greasy fingers get in the way of those surfaces. And what is the number one factor of greasy fingers? Let's say out loud what everyone thinks. Chips. Those delicious chips. 
Are we headed towards a future where we spend more time on our devices, and therefore less time eating chips? As if 2020 wasn't bad enough already. It's time for solutions. 

## Ever heard of chopsticks? ðŸ¥¢ 

Some of you have gone through the thinking process of "why on earth would I eat with the less practical tool existing?"... hold on to your reality as it may collapse. 

Here is a list of the main arguments for **CHIPSTICKS**. <br/>
_yes, it even has it's own name. That's how serious the situation is._

- No grease or crumbs on your hands. Re-discover the freedom of touching anything after this. 
- Chipsticks actually allow you to grab any form of chips *in contrario* of various spoons and sporks.  
- Eat them one or two at the time. As any great invention, it comes with it's own pack of wisdom. Chipsticks allow you enjoy chips for the singularity. Stop hiding yourself under complete chunks of chips that covers any sound you could make. Enjoy.
