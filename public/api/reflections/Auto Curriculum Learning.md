Create a function which creates a [[Curriculum Learning]] out of any datasets.

The idea of the curriculum learning is to make ML learn from easy to hard examples, improving the overall performances.

So if the learning datasets is in order composed of the most representative datas of the distribution and then finish towards the extreme distributions cases.

This could be automated (giving a probability score to datasets) and then ordered.

Two options : 
- The learning datasets is ordered
- The number of sets iteration learning is known in advance and the hardest samples are kept for the latest iterations.
