-   Synaptic plasticity, such as [[Long-term Potentation (LTP)]] (LTP) and [[Long-term Depression (LTD)]], must be tightly regulated to prevent saturation, which would impair #Learning. [[Metaplasticity]] mechanisms have evolved to help implement this essential computational constraint. Metaplasticity refers to neural changes that are induced by activity at one point in time and that persist and affect subsequently induced LTP or LTD.
    
-   The activation of NMDA (_N_-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors can cause a persistent reduction in LTP induction and an enhancement of LTD. These effects are synapse-specific, **last tens of minutes** and **contribute to LTD induction during conventional low-frequency stimulation protocols**. The mechanisms of this regulation are poorly understood, but activation of protein phosphatases and alteration of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II function are clear candidates.
    
-   Prior activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (group 1 mGluRs) **facilitates both the induction and the persistence of LTP in the hippocampus**. The facilitated induction probably involves depression of afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) and trafficking of AMPA (Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors to the extrasynaptic membrane, whereas the facilitated persistence entails _de novo_ local protein synthesis.

-   **Heterosynaptic metaplasticity that crosses between synapses can also occur**. Stimulation of protein synthesis by activity in one set of synapses can facilitate LTP persistence through a synaptic tag-and-capture process operating at a second set of weakly activated synapses. Heterosynaptic metaplasticity can also be mediated by altered postsynaptic ion-channel function and retrograde endocannabinoid signalling that reduces transmission at nearby inhibitory GABAergic terminals.
    
-   Behaviourally, **stress can inhibit LTP and facilitate LTD** through NMDA-receptor-dependent mechanisms. Sensory stimulation or deprivation alters plasticity thresholds in cortical regions, especially during developmental periods. Reductions in the slow AHP in piriform and hippocampal neurons support the learning of behavioural tasks, suggesting a metaplastic role for this mechanism in controlling learning-related plasticity thresholds.

-   The ability to harness metaplasticity mechanisms might contribute to strategies for treating adult amblyopia or the development of therapies aimed at improving cognition in individuals with neurological disorders. Metaplasticity paradigms also share commonalities with ischaemic preconditioning, so its mechanisms might present targets for preventing stroke in at-risk individuals.
    
-   In conclusion, metaplasticity is a major regulator of plasticity thresholds and therefore has a key role in **keeping synapses working in a range that permits the full expression of plasticity**. In turn, this helps to keep networks operating at an appropriate level for information processing and storage. Considerable research is still needed to clarify the mechanisms that underpin different forms of metaplasticity and their contribution to network dynamics and behavioural learning.
