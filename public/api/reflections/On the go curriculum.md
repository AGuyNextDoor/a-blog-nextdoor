Make a on the go curriculum. 

Inspired by the roadmap but the learning material is divided in a way that by simply selecting a minimal amount of sections per topic, the data is reassembled to create to perfect course.

Exemple : 
![qwe](On_the_go_Test.excalidraw.md)

(*Red is obligatory course*)

## The Data Model

Every course is divided individually in sections so that they can be combined properly after that.
That includes 
- Slides
- Exercises
- Links and material
- Quiz
