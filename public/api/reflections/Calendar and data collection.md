How to add an automation process based on calendar events?
- Check if anything online for that (IFTTT, Zapper, calendar?)

For example : I have a course planned that i will teach. I need to collect some data after teaching this course like 
- Ameliorations
- Which slide used
- Time it took
- ...

The automated calendar could send me a form to fill out at the end, contributing to the database.
