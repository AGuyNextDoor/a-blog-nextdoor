It is interesting to change some rules according to situations. 

Example : 
- Start with a huge map and the set of rules : [B: 3, 5; A:2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
- When independent blobs have formed, before their second phase of expansion, change the rules to [B: 4, 5; A:4, 5, 6, 7, 8], (which is highly defensive)
