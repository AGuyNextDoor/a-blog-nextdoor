# On the Measure of Intelligence (Ongoing Work)

## Definitions

Absence of generalization: Ai systems in which there is no uncertainty.

*Local generalization* (robustness): Adaptation to know n unknowns within a single task or well defined set of tasks. (Typical ML models)

*Broad Generalization* (flexibility): Adaptation to unknown unknowns across a broad category of related tasks. (self-driving vehicules)

*Extreme generalization*: Adaptation to unknown unknowns across an unknown range of tasks and domains. (Humans and some species)

*Broad abilities*: Cognitive abilities that lead to broad or extreme generaliation. Often meant in opposition to "local generalization".

*Psychometrics*: the field of study concerned with the theory and technique of psychological measurement, which includes the measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, and personality traits. The field is primarily concerned with the study of differences between individuals.

*g factor*: A hypothetic single factor of general intelligence.

*ability*: Abstract construct (based on theory and statistical phenomena) as to a directly measurable, objectve property of an individual mind (such as a score on a specific test).

## 1 Context and History

### 1.1 Need for an actionable definition and measure of intelligence

### 1.2 Defining intelligence : two divergent visions

*Intelligence*: "Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments." Legg and Hutter, summarizing 70 scientists in the context of AI research.

Two characterizations :

- Task specific.
- Generality and adaptation.

### 1.3 AI Evaluation: from measuring kills to measuring broad abilities

"When we know how a machine does something intelligent, it ceases to be regarded as intelligent. If I beat the world's chess champion, I'd be regarded as highly bright."
(Reed)

The difference between the world chess player and the AI playing chess, is that we imagine that the chess player could use this intelligence to be super good in a lot of things (*Golden Hand* effect).

*Generalization*: The ability to handle situations (or tasks) that differ from previously encountered situations.

Two types of generalization:

- **System-centric generalization**: Ability of a learning system to handle situations it has not itself encountered before.
- **Developer-aware generalization**: The ability of a system, either learning or static, to handle situations that neither the system not the developer of the system have encountered before.
